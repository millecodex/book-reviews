The Cryptopians: Idealism, greed, lies, and the making of the first big cryptocurrency craze.

Firstly, the title. This book should be called “The DAO hack: epic egos in times of childish greed” or maybe to borrow from TV: Silicon Valley meets big brother

•	One long timeline or stream of consciousness made it very hard to keep up momentum; at any given time you are unsure of what part of timeline your are in, not because its out of order, but because when you pick it up you have landmarks to guide you. The chapter headings are not that – no guideposts to be found in the table of contents.
•	The DAO hack takes up about 100 pages, or 25% of the book, and overall the book is about 100 pages too long. The DAO is important, a key milestone is decentralised governance and the foundations of ethereum itself, but I would have been happier if the minutiae were in an appendix.
•	One this point – detail – Laura is impeccable. This is her true strength and perhaps in another life she was a lawyer. The sheer volume of interviews conducted and notes parsed to get some form of narrative on the page is impressive.
•	Overall, the cryptopians is absolutely necessary in the library of crypto history. But not for the casual fan, crypto noob, or bitcoiner. This is an academic tome written by someone nerdy enough to have been a xxx
•	In the early stages of the book I kept becoming more and more incredulous with every passing back-and-forth that was relayed. The characters kept getting more outrageous. The astonishing behaviour of one being outdone by the next in epic battles of ego. And forgetfulness. How frustrating is must be for a fact checker when every response is either crickets or ‘I don’t recall’
•	Vitalik is not excusable here, its incredible he can manage day to day with the amount of conflict he actively avoids, the amount of abuse he tolerates, and the short memory he has.
•	There are four main characters here: Charles Hopkinson, Gavin Wood, Ming Chan, and Vitalik Buterin. Vitalik far and away is the most likeable. Charles is unfit to be unsupervised. Gavin is a weasel. And Ming. Ming Chen. You’ll have to read the book. It’s incredible she ever held a job.
•	Charles: as early as P.42 commented: what the hell did he actually do?
•	Ming: p.96: it just keeps getting worse! She’s a disaster! P.233 “Ming’s a shitshow”
•	You do learn the origin story of ethereum, and not just the Vitalik-at-Bitcoin-Magazine stuff. But the procedural things of turning an idea into software, developing flat org structures, and finding money to do it all.
•	I wasn’t following crypto and ethereum in these early days (2014-16) and so it was very enlightening getting an inside picture into events that I only had a headline view of
•	Some other stories are followed along the way such as Poloniex, My Ether Wallet, even Dentacoin gets more than one mention 
•	She wrote an epilogue to wrap things up and with only five! Page to go begins detailing her investigation into new details about the identity of the DAO hacker which leaves you wonder who this person is going to be, however, in a fit of Netflix sequel or just plain frustration it is not revealed. Cryptopians went to print in Janxxx of 2022 and shortly later a story broke about the identity. No spoilers here, they deny involvement.
•	Crypto has a lot of tricky and confusing technical topics, and like any field has its own lexicon. Shin does a good job attempting to explain many of them with metaphor, but some do fall flat.
•	One is so peculiar I must type it out: 
•	It was as if a person had been teleported to Komodo island and left alone with Komodo dragons after all the humans on the island had been airlifted out in a onetime helicopter rescue mission. Only he had done that not with himself but almost half a million dollars.
•	I won’t even provide context because it wont help!
•	In her favour she provides an excellent succinct definition of the DAO: “As such, the DAO was the first global, decentralised venture fund open to anyone from any country, rich or poor, young or old, experienced or naïve, who had access to the internet.”
